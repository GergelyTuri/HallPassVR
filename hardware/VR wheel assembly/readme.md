# Instructions and files for assembling the runinng wheel.

We use XXX" thick, clear acrylic to cut out the wheel parts found in `runningWheel_6inCyl_sideMount_JoVE_091422a.ai`.

#### Wheel laser cutting template:
[^1]: The same template is atteched here with .ai, .dxf and .svg extensions. 
[^2]: We used 1020 (dual) style extrusion profiles for this build for increased stability. Fasteners and brackets can also be sourced from 8020.net
