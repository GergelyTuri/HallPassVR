# Instructions for assembling the lickport

We developed a capacity-based lickport which is highly sensitive and easy to implement. Note: this type of lick sensor can introduce a significant amount of electric noise when the mouse licks the water spout which could be disadvantageous for electrophysiological recordings. Please contact @claylacefield or @GergelyTuri for alternative solutions.
