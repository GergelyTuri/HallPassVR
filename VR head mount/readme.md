# This folder contains assembly files and instructions for the head mounting apparatus. 

Our headpost design consists of two interlocking manifolds for securing a metal headpost. We used a high resolution tabletop SLM 3D printer to manufacture the holding arms. is component,  The resin printed plastic which is able to provide stable head fixation for behavior experiments, however, to achieve maximum stability for sensitive applications like single cell recording or two-photon imaging, we recommend using machined metal parts. The headpost holder is installed on two goniometers, with the tilting axes positioned perpendicular to each other, thus the animalâ€™s head can be tilted to 4 directions after head fixation to level the preparation. The goniometers can represent a large price tag in this build, however, this feature is indispensable for chronic in vivo imaging experiments when finding the same cell population on subsequent imaging sessions is required. We deposited two types of head posts with different complexity (and price) we regularly use in our labs. Depending on the experiment type, the user should decide which one to implement. The head bars are made of steel (e.g., Stainless 304 Annealed) and we generally outsource the manufacturing of these parts to our local machine shop or to an online service (e.g., eMachineShop).
