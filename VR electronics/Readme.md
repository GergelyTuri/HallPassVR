# Instructions for the electronic components

Files in the `ESP32 files` directory should be uploaded to the ESP32 boards connected to the lickport and rotary encoder. 

Files in `PCBs` can get manufatured with companies specialized to PCB production. Typically we use OSH Park if we don't want to modify the design. More info on how to order and assemble these shields can be found on [OpenMaze](http://www.openmaze.org/).
