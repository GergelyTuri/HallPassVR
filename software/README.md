# HallPassVR software
## Virtual reality system for head-fixed mouse experiments. 


## Arduino code
1. Rotary encoder ESP32
2. Behavior ESP32 (with OMwESP32 PCB shield)

## Analysis code
MATLAB code for analysis of spatial licking behavior using .txt file output from Processing behavioral acquisition.

## Processing code
Code in the Processing.org environment to acquire data from behavior ESP32 during HallPassVR and plot relevant online behavioral events (and animal motion along the virtual linear track).

## HallPassVR Python code
To be copied onto RaspberryPi to run HallPassVR virtual linear track environment and GUI.
